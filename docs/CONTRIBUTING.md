# Contributing

If you like to make changes to the source code, please follow these contribution guidelines.

## How to contribute?

Follow the [CGDS' best practices for code
development](http://cgds.uab.edu/manual-of-operations/standards-definitions/#standard-practices) (see sections IDE,
Source Control, Peer Reviews). The [Repo owner](../README.md#repo-owner) is responsible for reviewing, keeping standards,
and accepting the pull request into `origin/master`. Below is the brief listing of this process:

- Create new Git branch based off of the relevant branch (e.g., `origin/master`).
- Make your changes/additions within the new branch.
- Push branch to Github and submit the completed changes/additions via a Github pull request. In the pull request
  form, complete the checklist and add any necessary comments with appropriate details.
- [Repo owner](../README.md#repo-owner) will review the request and provide feedback, if any.
- When deemed complete, repo owner will merge this branch to master.


## Cloning the repository/pipeline

See [installation](./installation.md). If you are cloning branch other than `master`, use `-b` option to specify the
branch.
