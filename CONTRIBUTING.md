# Contributing

## How to contribute?

Follow the [CGDS' best practices for code development](http://cgds.uab.edu/manual-of-operations/standards-definitions/#standard-practices) (see sections IDE, Source Control, Peer Reviews). The [Repo owner](./README.md#Repo-owner) is responsible for reviewing, keeping standards, and accepting the merge request into `origin/master`. Below is the brief listing of this process:

- Create new Git branch based off of the relevant branch (`origin/master`).
- Make your changes/additions within the new branch.
- Push branch to GitLab and submit the completed changes/additions via a GitLab merge request. In the merge request form, choose `MERGE REQUEST TEMAPLTE` in the drop-down for `Title` and then complete merge request form in `Description` section with appropriate details.
- [Repo owner](./README.md#repo-owners) will review the request and provide feedback, if any.
- When deemed complete, repo owner will merge this branch to master.


## Cloning the repository/pipeline

See [README.md](./README.md#installation). If you are cloning branch other than `master`, use `-b` option to specify the branch.
