	abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has shown promise in becoming a first-tier diagnostic test for patients with rare genetic disorders; however, standards addressing the definition and deployment practice of a best-in-class test are lacking. To address these gaps, the Medical Genome Initiative, a consortium of leading healthcare and research organizations in the US and Canada, was formed to expand access to high-quality clinical WGS by publishing best practices. Here, we present consensus recommendations on clinical WGS analytical validation for the diagnosis of individuals with suspected germline disease with a focus on test development, upfront considerations for test design, test validation practices, and metrics to monitor test performance. This work also provides insight into the current state of WGS testing at each member institution, including the utilization of reference and other standards across sites. Importantly, members of this initiative strongly believe that clinical WGS is an appropriate first-tier test for patients with rare genetic disorders, and at minimum is ready to replace chromosomal microarray analysis and whole-exome sequencing. The recommendations presented here should reduce the burden on laboratories introducing WGS into clinical practice, and support safe and effective WGS testing for diagnosis of germline disease.},

              Background
              SAMtools and BCFtools are widely used programs for processing and analysing high-throughput sequencing data. They include tools for file format conversion and manipulation, sorting, querying, statistics, variant calling, and effect analysis amongst other methods.
            
            
              Findings
              The first version appeared online 12 years ago and has been maintained and further developed ever since, with many new features and improvements added over the years. The SAMtools and BCFtools packages represent a unique collection of tools that have been used in numerous other software projects and countless genomic pipelines.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Both SAMtools and BCFtools are freely available on GitHub under the permissive MIT licence, free for both non-commercial and commercial use. Both packages have been installed \&gt;1 million times via Bioconda. The source code and documentation are available from https://www.htslib.org.},

	abstract = {Detecting and estimating DNA sample contamination are important steps to ensure high-quality genotype calls and reliable downstream analysis. Existing methods rely on population allele frequency information for accurate estimation of contamination rates. Correctly specifying population allele frequencies for each individual in early stage of sequence analysis is impractical or even impossible for large-scale sequencing centers that simultaneously process samples from multiple studies across diverse populations. On the other hand, incorrectly specified allele frequencies may result in substantial bias in estimated contamination rates. For example, we observed that existing methods often fail to identify 10\% contaminated samples at a typical 3\% contamination exclusion threshold when genetic ancestry is misspecified. Such an incomplete screening of contaminated samples substantially inflates the estimated rate of genotyping errors even in deeply sequenced genomes and exomes. We propose a robust statistical method that accurately estimates DNA contamination and is agnostic to genetic ancestry of the intended or contaminating sample. Our method integrates the estimation of genetic ancestry and DNA contamination in a unified likelihood framework by leveraging individual-specific allele frequencies projected from reference genotypes onto principal component coordinates. Our method can also be used for estimating genetic ancestries, similar to LASER or
              TRACE
              , but simultaneously accounting for potential contamination. We demonstrate that our method robustly estimates contamination rates and genetic ancestries across populations and contamination scenarios. We further demonstrate that, in the presence of contamination, genetic ancestry inference can be substantially biased with existing methods that ignore contamination, while our method corrects for such biases.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              When interpreting sequencing data from multiple spatial or longitudinal biopsies, detecting sample mix-ups is essential, yet more difficult than in studies of germline variation. In most genomic studies of tumors, genetic variation is detected through pairwise comparisons of the tumor and a matched normal tissue from the sample donor. In many cases, only somatic variants are reported, which hinders the use of existing tools that detect sample swaps solely based on genotypes of inherited variants. To address this problem, we have developed Somalier, a tool that operates directly on alignments and does not require jointly called germline variants. Instead, Somalier extracts a small sketch of informative genetic variation for each sample. Sketches from hundreds of germline or somatic samples can then be compared in under a second, making Somalier a useful tool for measuring relatedness in large cohorts. Somalier produces both text output and an interactive visual report that facilitates the detection and correction of sample swaps using multiple relatedness metrics.
            
            
              Results
              We introduce the tool and demonstrate its utility on a cohort of five glioma samples each with a normal, tumor, and cell-free DNA sample. Applying Somalier to high-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project also identifies several related samples. We also demonstrate that it can distinguish pairs of whole-genome and RNA-seq samples from the same individuals in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Somalier is a tool that can rapidly evaluate relatedness from sequencing data. It can be applied to diverse sequencing data types and genome builds and is available under an MIT license at

FastQ Screen is intended to be used routinely as a quality control measure and for analysing samples in which the origin of the DNA is uncertain or has multiple sources.},
